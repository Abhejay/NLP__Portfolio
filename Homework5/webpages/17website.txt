This 2016 photo of him standing next to centers DeMarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan, who both are purportedly 6-11, doesn’t add up.Boogie joked that he told KD to stop standing next to him.

“I keep telling him to stop standing by me, man,” Cousins said jokingly at the time, according to Sporting News. “I think people are starting to figure out I might be about 6-7. He’s every bit of 7 feet, every bit.”It’s clear Durant is just as tall as his counterparts, if not taller. He actually addressed the height controversy that year in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, asserting bluntly that he’s actually 6-11.Although Durant will be sidelined with an Achilles’ injury in his first season with the Brooklyn Nets, we finally will learn this year how tall he and other NBA players truly are. The New York Times’ Marc Stein reported Tuesday the league told teams this week that they must submit the “precise height and age” for every player.AdvertisementNBA spokesman Mike Bass confirmed the report to The Washington Post on Thursday, adding, “A consistent process has been created to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data on team rosters.”This year, heights will be recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off, Stein reported. The rules for weight will be less strict because the number changes so frequently for many players.On the opposite side of the height spectrum from Durant is Dallas Mavericks guard J.J. Barea, who has been listed as 6-foot but told the Journal he’s actually “5-foot-10 on a good day.”@jjbareapr  you ok? https://t.co/p4pFduqn8O— Dirk Nowitzki (@swish41) September 26, 2019

Embellishing your height is commonplace in society (particularly in men’s dating profiles). But advertising yourself as shorter than reality is less common. Durant’s reason for rounding down all these years was to play his preferred position — and to have a little fun.Advertisement“For me, when I’m talking to women, I’m 7 feet. … In basketball circles, I’m 6-9,” Durant told the Journal. “Really, that’s the prototypical size for a small forward. Anything taller than that, and they’ll start saying, ‘Ah, he’s a power forward.’ ”Later, he told KNBR he fibs about his height because “I just like messin’ with people.”But there’ll be no more messin’ with people anymore. And that goes for representing the correct age, too, although there are likely fewer false instances of that in the NBA.The league’s focus on age seems to have stemmed from an issue last year with Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield. In December, Hield acknowledged he had recently turned 26, even though the NBA had listed him at 25. He blamed the league for the disparity.Kings’ Buddy Hield says he’s a year older than he’s been listed by the NBA“I came over with a passport,” Hield, who is from the Bahamas, told NBC Sports Bay Area. “My passport has 1992 on it. My driver’s license has 1992 on it. I just think people got their information from Wikipedia or wherever, and they just went with it. They just got it wrong.”AdvertisementRead more on the NBA:Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inboxAdam Silver on NBA’s stricter tampering rules: Fans ‘were losing confidence in our system’NBA fines Bucks for tampering with Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is on the BucksAn ode to the NBA’s ‘ninja-style’ headbands: Gone but not forgottenDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleView moreLoading...TOP STORIESThe DMV GuideWhether you’re a lifelong resident of D.C. or you just moved here, we’ve got you covered.Everything you need to know about the National Cherry Blossom FestivalReview|Foraged in Baltimore celebrates a few of the chef’s favorite thingsRoger Goodell, Muriel Bowser discussed future of RFK site in December callRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferencesCompanyAbout The Post Newsroom Policies & Standards Diversity and Inclusion Careers Media & Community Relations WP Creative Group Accessibility Statement Get The PostGift Subscriptions Mobile & Apps Newsletters & Alerts Washington Post Live Reprints & Permissions Post Store Books & E-Books Newspaper in Education Print Archives (Subscribers Only) Today’s Paper Public Notices Contact UsContact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Contact the Opinions team Advertise Licensing & Syndication Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Terms of UseDigital Products Terms of Sale Print Products Terms of Sale Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices washingtonpost.com  © 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The Post Contact the Newsroom Contact Customer Care Request a Correction Send a News Tip Report a Vulnerability Download the Washington Post App Policies & Standards Terms of Service Privacy Policy Cookie Settings Print Products Terms of Sale Digital Products Terms of Sale Submissions & Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices
