The first espresso machines were invented in the early 1900s, with the first patent being filed by Luigi Bezzera in 1901. The modern espresso machine, which uses a pump to create pressure and force water through compacted, finely ground coffee, was invented by Achille Gaggia in 1945. The popularity of espresso quickly spread throughout Europe and eventually to the rest of the world, leading to the creation of many different espresso-based drinks such as cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos."
