Description:
The program reads a CSV file to process the text and standardize the data. An object for each person is created and the information is outputed.

How to Run:
To run the program edit configurations in Pycharm and add data/data.csv as the parameter.

Strengths/Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing:
Text Processing in Python is pretty strong in my opinion. There are many functions that are easy to implement such as capitalize and remove which make it easy to format your text. There is no weakness that I knew immediately, but using regex was a bit difficult as there were many expressions that could be used.

What I learned:
This is my first class learning Python and it introduced me to object oriented concepts by creating the Person class. I also learned many of the different functions that could be used for text processing in Python. Regex was pretty difficult to understand initially, but after a bit of reading it became much more easier to use it and how powerful of a tool it is. The use of the system aregument in order to read in the file was something new and it is definitely something that I will be using more.
